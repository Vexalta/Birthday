    "In the vast, rolling plains where golden grasses sway beneath endless skies, the Kingdom of New Auradon rose — a beacon of peace and hope. Its castle stands tall, built brick by brick, by hands both skilled and guided by unseen forces.

    The King and Queen who rule this land are unlike any others. Their origins remain cloaked in whispers and questions.
    
    The King, a figure of quiet strength, is said to wield an uncanny power — one that shapes stone and earth as easily as one might weave cloth. It is said that when he placed the very first brick of the castle, the ground itself seemed to hum in recognition, as if awakening to a long-lost call. The Queen, radiant and wise, is believed to hold ancient knowledge that guides their rule — her insight as sharp as the blade she wears at her side, yet tempered with kindness and grace.
    
    Together, they built the kingdom, each stone laid with care and precision. Guided by visions whispered from an unknown world, the King watched over every wall as it rose, moving with a silent power that made the impossible seem effortless. The Queen, with gentle authority, rallied their people — inspiring hope and unity across the plains.
    
    It is said that the King possesses a rare gift — the power to command the very fabric of this realm. With a mere thought, he bends stone and soil to his will, raising walls, summoning towers, and conjuring battlements with impossible speed and precision, as though the land itself were eager to obey his call. This power to shape the kingdom, brick by brick and breath by breath, is unique to him alone — a secret art no other soul may wield.
    
    Both the King and Queen are said to soar above the lands, their wings unseen but their flight undeniable, gliding effortlessly across the skies as the guardians of New Auradon. They command the skies and seasons alike — summoning rain to nourish crops, clearing storms that threaten their people, and shifting day to night or night to day as their wisdom deems necessary to protect and nurture the realm. With but a thought, they can vanish from one corner of the kingdom and reappear in another, traversing great distances in the blink of an eye. Their knowledge of the world is vast beyond measure — from the deepest caverns to the farthest wilds, they understand every creature, every hidden path, and every secret the land has yet to yield.
    
    The true mystery lies not only in their origins, but in the extent of their powers. Villagers whisper of strange lights that follow them in the sky, of stars bending to their will, and of a silent aura that fills the air whenever they walk among their people. Their eyes hold secrets deeper than the oldest caves, and their presence commands awe, respect, and wonder.
    
    One fateful night, this power was put to the test when a band of illagers, driven by greed and envy, sought to raid the kingdom. They came under the cover of darkness, with crude weapons and fierce intent. Yet, as they crossed the boundary into New Auradon’s lands, they were met by a force unlike any they had imagined.
    
    The King, standing tall and silent atop the castle’s highest tower, unleashed his unique power — the earth itself obeying his command, walls shifting and rising with a life of their own. The Queen, by his side, called upon the winds and shadows, cloaking the kingdom in an impenetrable veil.
    
    With a single gesture, the ground beneath the illagers’ feet surged, tossing them back like ragdolls. Their weapons shattered, their courage faltered, and one by one, they fled into the night — never daring to return.
    
    Since that night, no illager has dared set foot near the kingdom’s borders. Tales of the King and Queen’s power spread far and wide, whispered in fearful tones by those who would threaten peace.
    
    Yet, despite their formidable gifts and the mysteries that surround them, the King and Queen rule with a gentle hand. Their hearts are devoted not to conquest, but to the prosperity of their people. Fields flourish, homes grow strong, and harmony reigns where once there was only uncertainty.
    
    No one truly knows where the King and Queen came from. Some say they were born from the very essence of the plains themselves — ancient gods summoned to bring balance. Others whisper that they hail from a distant realm beyond the stars, travelers between dimensions. Whatever the truth, their arrival marked a turning point, and their presence has forever changed the fate of New Auradon.
    
    Under their watchful eyes, New Auradon is more than a kingdom — it is a sanctuary, a promise of hope, and a testament to what can be built when strength and kindness walk hand in hand.”
    
    — Eldric, Keeper of Tales
